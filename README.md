# Millikan-Oil-Drop

Repo containing the jupyter notebook that I used to perform an analysis for the Millikan Oil Drop experimental. Apparataus setup based at the University of Glasgow. 

The notebook is written in python3, and should work out of the box. There are 8 datasets to play around with. One with data collected by myself in February and 7 others collected by students, their names have been anonymised.
